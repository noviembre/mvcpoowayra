        <h2>Do I need to be fit to do one of your treks?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">All of our treks (the Inca Trail, Salkantay, Ausangate etc.) are moderately difficult, long and mountainous. We highly recommend that you are relatively fit and acclimatised to altitude (a minimum of 2 days at altitude) before undertaking them.  During the months (or at the very least, one month) before your trip, you should take regular, moderate exercise.  We want you to have an amazing experience and the fitter you are, the more enjoyable the treks will be.</p>

        <h2>What's altitude sickness?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">
            What Causes Altitude Illnesses :
            The primary cause of altitude illnesses is going too high too quickly. Given time, your body can adapt to the decrease in oxygen at specific altitudes. This is known as acclimatization and generally takes 1 to 3 nights at a given altitude.</p>
        <p class="long-copy">
            Prevention of Altitude Illnesses:
            Prevention of altitude illnesses falls into two categories, proper acclimatization and preventive medications. Below are a few basic guidelines for proper acclimatization. Start below 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) and walk up.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;Do not over-exert yourself or move higher for the first 24 hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;If you go above 10,000 feet (3,048 meters), only increase your sleeping elevation by 1,000 feet (305 meters) per day and for every 3,000 feet (915 meters) of elevation gained, take a rest day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;If you begin to show symptoms of moderate altitude illness, don't go higher until symptoms decrease&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;If symptoms increase, go down, down, down! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Keep in mind that different people will acclimatize at different rates.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Stay properly hydrated.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Take it easy; don't over-exert yourself when you first get up to altitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Avoid tobacco, alcohol and other depressant drugs including, barbiturates, tranquilizers, and sleeping pills.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Eat a high carbohydrate diet while at altitude.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="long-copy">
            Preventive Medications  (requiring prescriptions):


            * Diamox (Acetazolamide) changes acid balance which allows you to increase breathing and improve oxygen uptake - the same mechanism as in normal acclimatization , but  faster

            * Dexamethasone (a steroid) is a drug that decreases brain and other swelling, helping to reverse the effects.

        <h2>Is the number of visitors to Machu Picchu limited like those of the Inca Trail?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">The number of visitors to the archeological site of Machu Picchu has a limit of 2500 per day, which is an attempt to keep in line with UNESCO recommendations. During July 2011, several visitors were unable to secure an entrance ticket when they arrived at Aguas Calientes. Therefore, it is recommended to book in advance, especially during the high season. The trains are usually full so make your reservations in advance. You can book your visit to MP only or a ticket including the Huayna Picchu trek.</p>

        <h2>Hows`s the shorter 2 day 1 night Inca Trail?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">The shorter Inca Trail is for those visitoros with limited time on their hands or who just want to take things a little bit easier but still trek the Inca Trail. This trek starts at km104 and ascends to the ruins of Wiñay Wayna before continuing on to MP. Since you don't have much time at MP on the first day, most people spend the night at the town of Aguas Calientes and return to MP again the following day. This trail is subject to the Inca Trail regulations and trek permits must be reserved in advance as well.</p>

        <h2>Is there a waiting list?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">There is no such thing as a WAITLIST / CANCELLATION LIST. If any agency tells you that they can do this, they are simply not telling the truth and are operating illegally! Its as simple as if a passenger cancels their space is not given to anybody else - period!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fila">
        <h2>Is it possible to enter with a differente ID?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">
No, you need to carry a valid ID (passport) with the name you used during your booking to enter the park.
        </p>

    <div class="fila">
        <h2>What's an extra porter? Do I need one?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">We always ask you if you want the help of a personal porter to carry your extra luggage (sleeping bag, sleeping mattress, clothes, etc). This is a good idea if you are not used to hiking. It helps you enjoy the trail more!  You can then walk with just your daypack carrying whatever you need for the day like water, sunblock, rain jacket, camera, snacks, etc. Keep it light!</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Student discount with a Valid ISIC card.</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">If you are a student with a valid ISIC (international students card) then you are entitled to a discount. (USD40.00). In order to claim this discount you need to provide the agency with a scanned in copy of your card and travel with the card on the trail. If you do not have your card with you on the trail you will be obliged to pay the full fare.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fila">
        <h2>What about toilets?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">Toilets have improved a lot in the last couple of years and all of the larger campsites have toilet blocks with flush toilets and running water. On the whole they are kept pretty clean. If you do need to go to the toilet between campsites then defecate well away from the trail and water supplies; dig a hole, or cover your feces with a rock, and take the paper with you in a bag to deposit in one of the several bins along the way. There are hot shower facilities in Wiñay Wayna on day 3, although they are usually unclean.

            Important: As a sustainable tourism operator and to show how much we care for our porters we do NOT take portable toilets. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fila">
        <h2>What should I do as my trek date approaches?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">Please come by the agency at least 48 hours prior to your tour to meet, finalise details, pay your balance and organise your pre-trek talk (if applicable - Inca Trail / alternative treks).</p>
    </div>


    <div class="fila">
        <h2>How is the food on the treks?</h2>
        <p class="long-copy">Many people comment that our food they eat on the treks is the best they get whilst in Peru.<br />A sample menu is as follows:<br /><br /><strong>Breakfast</strong>&nbsp;- Porridge, toast, butter, jam, pancakes, fruit salad, yogurt with hot chocolate, coffee and a variety of teas.<br /><strong>Snack</strong>&nbsp;- Every day you are provided with a snack to eat whilst trekking, this is usually something like a power bar + fruit or biscuits + fruit.<br /><strong>Lunch</strong>&nbsp;- Soup + a main course ranging from Lomo Saltado, Causa Rellena, Trout, Spaghetti Bolagnese etc. served with rice and garlic bread<br /><strong>Happy Hour</strong>&nbsp;- Every afternoon around 5pm we serve hot chocolate, tea, popcorn, biscuits, bread and jam, etc.<br /><strong>Dinner</strong>&nbsp;- See the main courses served at lunch.</p>
